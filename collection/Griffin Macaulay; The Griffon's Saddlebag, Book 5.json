On a hit, the target takes {@damage 3d6} piercing damage (without adding your Strength modifier), or {@damage 6d6} piercing damage if the target is an object or structure. If you hit a creature and roll a 6 on any of the d6s, the target is also pushed up to 10 feet away from you.

When you hit a target with this weapon and roll the highest possible number on its damage die, it deals an extra {@damage 1d6} fire damage. You can only deal this extra fire damage once per turn.",
					"In addition, you can use a bonus action to cast the {@spell ensnaring strike} spell from the weapon (save DC 13). This version of the spell doesn't require {@status concentration} and deals fire damage, instead of piercing damage, to a target {@condition restrained} by it. Once this property of the {@item club|PHB} has been used, it can't be used again until the next dawn."
